In this project I will try making a functioning neural network module from scratch to learn more about neural networks and prove myself I am capable of doing this. 

No machine learning modules will be used. (only numpy will be used)

**It is not supposed to be used for real projects. Please use more advanced libraries like pytorch and tensorflow!**
